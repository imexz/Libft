# Libft
This project is about coding a C library, containing some of the standard C library and other general purpose utility functions.

Its goal is to understand how these functions work, implement and learn how to use them for further projects during the Core Curriculum at 42HN.

### Usage

`make` - compile the source files and create the library

`make clean` - removes object files

`make fclean` - calles clean and removes library

`make re` - recompiles in a clean environment
